# Adversarial-Minimax-for-Connect-N

This is a second-year project where I implemented a Minimax algorithm with and without Alpha-Beta pruning to compete against a player in games of Connect-N. Only the file "player.py" is produced by myself, the remaining files were provided as the framework for the project specification.

Please enter the game by running runGame.py using python. Altering the "g.playGame(X)" (within runGame.py) for X = True or X = False will toggle on and off the alpha-beta pruning opponent.
